This app searches the users computer for AAX, AU and VST audio plugins. The information is displayed in a GUI that allows for searching and exporting options.

It creates a database of the found information and can be exported as a CSV file. Plugin information can be exported as one large list of information or it can be separated into separate categories.

Another drive can also be searched either by connecting over AFP/SMB or by connecting a boot drive directly. This is stored separately from the any other "systems".
